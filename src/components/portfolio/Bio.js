                        <p className="text-center">My interests in programming and development actually grew out of my love for technology. 
                        For several years now I've been an actively involved tech enthusiast. My obsession started with smartphones. 
                        My very first smartphone was the iPhone 3GS, it was my first step into the newly arisen smartphone revolution. 
                        Currently, I am interested in both Android and Apple devices and will interchange between platforms.
                        Not long after that, I began to develop love for all sorts of technology and gadgets. 
                        After some time I decided that using and admiring tech wasn't enough for me so I turned to something even better, programming. 
                        It became obvious to me that I wanted to develop software for the devices I was so invested in and more. 
                        My first programming language was C#, as I was learning to develop in C# 
                        it felt like a whole new world of possibilities and that is what I absolutely love about programming, you can do most anything with it.
